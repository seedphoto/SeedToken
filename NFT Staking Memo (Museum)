Exclusivity, global recognition, and groundbreaking opportunities for artists and collectors.

NFT STAKING CONCEPT FOR THE SEED.PHOTO NFT MARKETPLACE

OVERVIEW
The SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace introduces an innovative NFT staking model that
combines exclusivity, global recognition, and financial rewards. This initiative,
branded as the “Museum” on SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace, offers an unparalleled
experience for art lovers, NFT collectors, galleries, and exhibitions, redefining
the intersection of fine art and blockchain technology.

NFT STAKING MECHANISM

SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace introduces a
groundbreaking staking model, the first
of its kind globally, offering instant annual
rewards. Here’s how it works:


(01)
NFT PURCHASE AND STAKING
Buyers, including art enthusiasts, collectors, galleries, and exhibitions, can stake their newly acquired NFTs directly on the platform right after purchase.

(02)
ANNUAL REWARDS

Stakers receive 20% of the NFT’s purchase price, paid
in advance as a one-time payout in BNB, directly to their
wallets.
• Example: If an NFT is purchased for $10,000 (in
Ethereum, BNB, or equivalent), the buyer receives $2,000
immediately upon staking.

(03)
USAGE RIGHTS FOR PROMOTION

By staking their NFT, buyers grant SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace
the promotional rights to use the artwork for one year. During
this period, the platform will utilize the NFT in exhibitions,
galleries, summits, and other promotional events globally,
ensuring maximum exposure and monetization potential.


BENEFITS OF THE MODEL
