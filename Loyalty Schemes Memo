Discover SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace – where photographers and collectors thrive
in a groundbreaking Web3 ecosystem. Incentivized participation, transparent
rewards, and cost-neutral engagement redefine loyalty and creativity.


LOYALTY SCHEMES
UTILIZING SEED.PHOTO TOKEN
ON SEED.PHOTO NFT
MARKETPLACE

OBJECTIVE
This proposal outlines the design and implementation of loyalty schemes
utilizing the SEED.Photo token to incentivize and reward photographers and NFT
collectors within the SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace ecosystem. These loyalty
schemes will foster community engagement, minimize user costs, and provide
a revolutionary monetization model in the Web3 space.


To support these loyalty schemes, 35%
of the total SEED.Photo token allocation will
be locked in smart contracts, divided as
follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTION BALLOT
CONTRACT:
Allocated specifically for disbursing rewards under the
loyalty schemes.

These smart contracts ensure transparency, security, and automated
distribution of SEED.Photo tokens.


FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS
Photographers are the cornerstone of SEED.Photo. 
The loyalty scheme for photographers is
designed to:
• Offset gas fees incurred during the minting and listing
process.
• Provide direct monetization opportunities.


(01)
MINTING REWARDS
• When photographers mint an artwork, they receive
0.5 SEED.Photo tokens automatically.
• This reward exceeds the gas fee on most supported
blockchains, such as BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, and SUI,
effectively making the minting process not only gas-free
but also, profitable.

(02)
LISTING REWARDS
• When photographers list an artwork for sale, they
receive another 0.5 SEED.Photo tokens.
• This ensures that listing is incentivized, encouraging
photographers to actively engage with the marketplace.


BENEFITS FOR
PHOTOGRAPHERS
• SEED.Photo becomes a zero-cost
platform, even on blockchains with higher gas fees.
• Photographers gain monetization opportunities
simply by uploading and minting their work, irrespective of
sales.
• The system introduces the first-ever model, where
photographers can earn money without listing or selling
their work.

(01)
RELEASE REWARDS
• When a collector releases (re-sells or trades) an
NFT, they receive 0.5 SEED.Photo tokens.
• This encourages active trading and fosters a vibrant
secondary market.

(02)
RESTRICTIONS
• Only photographers who have passed a
rigorous KYC process can mint artworks.
Collectors who are not approved artists, are not
allowed to mint. 
• This exclusivity ensures that SEED.Photo 
remains a trusted and high-quality platform for verified
photographers.


SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace currently supports BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum,
Polygon, and SUI.
• On blockchains like BNB, Polygon, and SUI, the 0.5 SEED token reward
is approximately 2x the gas fee based on the January 2025 market prices.
• This ensures that SEED.Photo NFT Marketplace becomes a cost-neutral or
profit-making platform for users, encouraging adoption and loyalty.

(03)
FOR SEED.PHOTO NFT MARKETPLACE

• Enhanced user retention and platform loyalty.
• A unique selling proposition (USP) in the competitive
NFT marketplace sector.


(01)
TOKEN ALLOCATION &
CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT

• Lock 35% of SEED.Photo tokens in two smart contracts
(treasury and distribution ballot).


BY INTEGRATING THESE INNOVATIVE LOYALTY
SCHEMES, SEED.PHOTO POSITIONS
ITSELF AS A PIONEERING PLATFORM THAT
ELIMINATES BARRIERS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS,
INCENTIVIZES COLLECTORS, AND SETS A NEW
BENCHMARK IN WEB3 MONETIZATION. THESE
SCHEMES NOT ONLY EMPOWER USERS BUT
ALSO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND
SUCCESS OF THE ECOSYSTEM.
